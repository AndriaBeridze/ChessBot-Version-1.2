# ChessBot-Version-1.0
I'd like to introduce you to my ChessBot, created by me. It's a simple and straightforward bot designed for playing chess. It doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles; it's just a basic AI that you can play chess against. While it might not be groundbreaking or super advanced, it's a great way to practice and enjoy a game of chess whenever you want.
